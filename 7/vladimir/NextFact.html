    A video game based on the film was released on November 4, 2004, for the Game Boy Advance,
     developed by Human Soft and published by Crave Entertainment. The game follows the same plot as the movie. In the majority of the levels,
      the player has to collect candies throughout each level while avoiding various objects and polar bears, whilst several levels consist of
       minigames,  such as flying Santa's sleigh, or engaging in a snowball fight. The game received generally negative reviews.
