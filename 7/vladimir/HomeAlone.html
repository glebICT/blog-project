            It's been 30 years since the comedy "Home Alone" hit theaters and became an instant classic.

            Thanks to Macaulay Culkin's memorable performance, decades later the movie about a boy who is left home alone and must come up with ways to project his home from burglars during Christmas has become a must-watch over the holidays.
            
            The Chris Columbus-directed movieis also beneffited from the slapstick physical comedy of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, along with John Williams' score that makes you all warm inside.
            
            Let's check in on the cast and see what they are doing now 30 years later.
