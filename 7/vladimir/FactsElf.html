Did You Know?

    One of the most famous elves in history is called Puck, from Shakespeare's play A Midsummer's Night Dream, who is a jester and servant to fairy king
    In medieval Britain it was believed that if first thing in the morning you found tangles in your horse's mane, it was caused by elves trying to braid the mane overnight. These tangles were called "elf-locks".
    It was J.R.R. Tolkien who changed the way we spell the word to talk about things related to elves, like elven clothes. He spelled it "elven", which is the word most people use today. At the time he was writing, the most common word was "elfin".
