         <h5>first day of blog, March 21, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#20: "Code Geass” (2006-08)</p>
         <img src="anime 20.jpg" width="750" height="500" alt="">
         <p style="font-size: 20px">Exiled from his home of Britannia in Japan, which his nation has conquered, Lelouch
            seeks to instigate a rebellion and take revenge on his father and his homeland. To accomplish this, he
            utilizes the show’s title ability, Geass, to make anyone he sees to exactly what he tells them, as well as
            leading a rebellion as a masked vigilante in a giant mech. “Code Geass” casts a wide net and has a little
            something for everyone, from mecha fans, to fans of psychological battles, to those who enjoy school anime;
            reeling them all in for one exceptional series. And with its revival movie and future series, it appears
            Geass hype is at an all-time high.</p>

      <h5>March 22, 2024</h5>
      <p style="font-size: 35px">#19: “One-Punch Man” (2015-)</p>
      <img src="anime 10.jpg" width="650" height="600" alt="">
      <p style=" font-size: 20px">Who says superheroes have to be serious? Saitama may look goofy and unimpressive and he
         becomes a superhero for fun, but it just so happens he’s the strongest one alive. His ability to defeat nearly any
         opponent with just one punch earns him disbelief and occasionally admiration, as his attempts to turn pro lead to
         many intense and often funny battles. The series’ wonderful contrast between serious action and comedic moments is
         emphasized through superb animation and expertly crafted fight scenes – and being featured on both Netflix and
         Toonami in the states, its no surprise it became so widespread.</p>

         <h2>Day 3</h2>
         <h5>March 23, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#18: “Sword Art Online” (2012-)</p>
         <img src="anime 60.jpg" width="530" height="650" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">You can hate on it all you want, but the original works still stands as one of the
            highest selling light novels of all time, something that seemed to translate to the first season of the anime upon
            release. Trapped inside a virtual video game world, players Kirito and Asuna have to traverse a gauntlet filled
            with enemy players, monsters and the occasional awkward love scene. Its immense polarisation has only served to
            earn it more attention, which might explain how it’s landed itself multiple spin offs and sequels.</p>

         <h5>March 24, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#17: “Bleach” (2004-12)</p>
         <img src="anime 30.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">A supernatural Shonen battle series, “Bleach” follows Ichigo Kurosaki, a human turned
            Soul Reaper, whose conflicts with otherworldly foes take him and his friends into various dimensions of the
            afterlife. The show’s emphasis on youthful rebellion really strikes a chord with younger viewers, and its great
            fight scenes and enormous cast of characters ensure that older demographics find something too. While “Bleach” may
            have fallen off sharply in popularity towards its conclusion, its highs are still fondly remembered by old fans
            and joyously discovered by new ones, and we can’t wait for the anime continuation.</p>

         <p style="font-size: 35px">#16: “Fullmetal Alchemist” franchise (2003-04; 2009-10)</p>
         <img src="anime 40.jpg" width="550" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">You don’t get recognised as one of the greatest anime of all time without doing something
            right. When the original series exploded onto the scene, it captivated fans everywhere with the Elric brothers’
            tale of redemption, the artistic portrayal of alchemy, as well as the characterisation of the fearsome Homonculi.
            Then along came Brotherhood and ramped everything up to eleven with a narrative much more akin to creator Hiromu
            Arakawa’s original work. It’s philosophical views and amazing action scenes have cemented It as a top-tier series
            that many anime lovers consider sacred.</p>

         <h5>March 26, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#15: “Neon Genesis Evangelion” (1995-96)</p>
         <img src="anime 50.jpg" width="850" height="500" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">One of the influential and critically acclaimed mecha anime of all time, “Neon Genesis
            Evangelion” depicts the tribulations of Shinji Ikari as he is forced to battle massive angels by his diabolical
            father. “Evangelion” combines psychological examinations of its fundamentally flawed characters with some
            excellent mecha action and plenty of symbolic imagery. Love it or hate though, the series introduced a whole
            generation to the genre while also turning it on its head; earning it an enduring popularity and several remakes
            and sequels… and with Netflix now holding its license, it’s even more accessible than ever.</p>

         <h5>March 27, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#14: “Fate/stay night” Franchise (2006-)</p>
         <img src="anime 70.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">A massively successful multimedia franchise, which began as a visual novel series, the
            “Fate” franchise usually follows a succession of powerful magi who engage in battles with one another using
            summoned spirits in order to attain the Holy Grail, which will grant them one wish. The series has had a huge
            number of sequels, spin-offs, and tie-ins across various media, and the anime have proved especially popular. The
            top notch animation and wide variety of entry points has made it a very accessible, and therefore well-liked,
            franchise… and it doesn’t hurt that “Fate Grand Order” is one of the most popular apps in Japan.</p>

         <h2>Day 8</h2>
         <h5>March 28, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#13: “Sailor Moon” franchise (1992-97; 2016)</p>
         <img src="anime 80.jpg" width="" height="" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">It was the first successful shoujo anime to hit the western mainstream, the titular
            character is considered to be one of the greatest female superheroes of all time, and has since acted as a
            benchmark for numerous other series that have followed in her footsteps. So yeah, Sailor Moon is a big deal! Her
            empowering example to young girls remains nothing short of inspirational, while the fight scenes and romantic
            elements could still be enjoyed by plenty of other demographics. It’s little surprise she and the rest of the
            Senshi came back for an encore twenty years later via Sailor Moon Crystal.</p>

         <h2>Day 9</h2>
         <h5>March 29, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#12: “Detective Conan” (1996-)</p>
         <img src="anime 90.jpg" width="450" height="650" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">With over a thousand episodes under its belt, over twenty movies, and zero signs of
            slowing down. There is only one truth, and it’s that Conan’s crime-solving exploits are likely going to outlive us
            all. Something of a national treasure, it’s maintained its place as the fourth highest-selling manga of all time
            for a fair while now with over 200 million copies sold. We’re not sure how many more crimes that the pint-sized
            detective can solve by this point, but given how there’s still no end in sight, the anime is bound to continue its
            steady stream of success.</p>

         <h2>Day 10</h2>
         <h5>March 30, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#11: “My Hero Academia” (2016-)</p>
         <img src="anime 100.jpg" width="650" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">One of the more recent anime sensations sweeping the globe, “My Hero Academia” takes
            place in a world where most people have superpowers. The story follows Izuku Midoriya, a once powerless boy now
            granted one by his hero and the adventures of he and his classmates on the road to becoming professional heroes.
            While its superhero roots certainly make it easy to get into, “My Hero Academia” expertly balances a large cast of
            diverse and unique characters, exciting, emotionally satisfying action, and an intriguing ongoing storyline about
            the nature of heroism; making for a fantastically addicting anime. And you can’t beat that soundtrack!</p>

         <h5>March 31, 2024</h5>
         <p style="font-size: 35px">#10: “Yu-Gi-Oh!” Franchise (1998-)</p>
         <img src="anime 110.jpg" width="600" height="650" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">Spanning twenty years and counting, “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and its various sequels focus on
            characters playing the Duel Monsters card game in increasingly dramatic circumstances. Although their casts vary,
            common themes and content include their young casts battling with a card game with real stakes, themes of
            friendship, as well as various ridiculous hairstyles. The tie-in card game and various video games and other
            merchandise have helped make “Yu-Gi-Oh!” not just one of the most popular anime, but also one of the highest
            grossing media franchises ever.</p>

         <h5>April 1, 2024</h5>

         <img src="anime 120.jpg" width="500" height="750" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">“Gundam” has a much storied history. A seminal mecha franchise, the “Gundam” series
            pioneered the genre by emphasizing more real world science behind the fantastical concept of giant mech suits and
            has been tremendously influential in anime as well as other forms of Japanese media and its legacy is still going
            strong and making history today. The word “Gundam” has become something of a byword for giant, piloted robots, and
            when the title of your franchise becomes synonymous with your genre, you know it’s popular.</p>

         <img src="anime 130.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">While the franchise already had quite a number of fans stemming from the long running 80s
            manga, it’s popularity wouldn’t explode until the release of the 2012 Anime series. Spanning multiple generations
            of the Joestar family, this franchise is so deeply rooted within the anime fandom that you’d be hard pressed not
            to see the parodies and references that litter the internet. With four series already aired and with the latest,
            Stone Ocean making its way to Netflix as an exclusive, the JoJo franchise has certainly made it’s place and won’t
            be going anywhere for a very long time.</p>

         <img src="anime 140.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">Like a bat out of hell, this series exploded onto the screen and almost instantly got
            itself a following of hardcore fans. Blending together visceral action, dark fantasy and mature elements that have
            continued to rattle us over the years, humanity’s ongoing battle against the Titans has managed to carve itself a
            spot as a modern classic among anime lovers. The manga has sold over 71 million copies the world over and the
            Anime has multiple seasons. If it keeps up the pace, then it’s fair to say a lot of golden oldies are going to get
            dethroned.</p>

         <img src="anime 150.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">The anime that struck gold. With but a single series, this now legendary title managed to
            establish itself as one of the smartest and most beautifully crafted examples of the occult detective genre ever
            put to both screen and paper. After finding himself in possession of a notebook capable of taking lives, genius
            sociopathic student Light Yagami vows to fix the world but cutting away those he views as rotten, only to find
            himself brought into conflict with an intellectual equal known as L. Both lead characters have had such a profound
            impact that there are still some who sees Light’s murderous actions as justified, while others still insist L is
            still the sexiest man alive. Go figure.</p>

         <img src="anime 160.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">What started out as an innovative video game managed to turn itself into a miniature
            empire, one that spawned an anime series that somehow has found a way to keep going even to this day. Hoping to be
            the best like no one ever was, Ash Ketchum took the place of the player as he set out to become a Pokemon Master.
            While he hasn’t quite managed to achieve that title yet (or escape puberty for that matter) his adventures have
            still managed to earn him hundreds upon hundreds of episodes, numerous female sidekicks and pretty much the
            guarantee that sometimes quantity over quality can win the day. That, and a catchy rap.</p>

         <img src="anime 170.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">In such a short amount of time, Demon Slayer has grown into a mega hit that absolutely no
            one saw coming. Propelled by it’s absolutely stunning Anime adaptation by the masters at Ufotable, manga sales
            have been through the roof, surpassing even the latest volumes of One Piece. And to top that all off, the movie
            based on the “Mugen Train” arc not only became the highest grossing Anime movie of all time, but the highest
            grossing worldwide film of 2020. Even the Prime Minister of Japan is a fan!</p>

         <img src="anime 180.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">It was saturated with filler episodes and gained infamy for a few narrative decisions.
            Yet through it all the knuckle-headed ninja persisted to give us a series that despite its flaws created a world
            filled with so many brilliant moments that fans were more than happy to push past its hurdles. Its manga remains a
            best seller, it managed to dish out a whole slew of original movies, and even got itself a sequel series that has
            surprisingly managed to capture some of the best parts of the original. Who would have guessed?</p>

         <img src="anime 190.jpg" width="500" height="650" alt="">
         <p style=" font-size: 20px">It’s the best-selling manga of all time, only just entered the last third of its epic
            narrative saga, and somehow managed to blend batshit insane fight scenes with political poignant commentary. To
            say that this property is a masterpiece would be an understatement. Thankfully, the crazy quality of the work
            hasn’t only earned it a diehard set of loyalist fans who wait on each new chapter and episode like hungry wolves,
            but the way it bypassed all manner of shonen conventions has made it the gold standard for all adventure anime
            that have come after. It will be a truly sad day when Luffy has to hang up his hat.</p>

         <p style=" font-size: 20px">Redefining the west’s perspectives on how action and animation can go hand in hand, it’s
            fair to say that this series, especially in the case of Dragon Ball Z, was something of a revolution for many,
            opening the gateway to the wacky, wild and wonderful stories that could be found in anime. It’s impact certainly
            hasn’t been forgotten, which might explain why its sequel series, Dragon Ball Super, has managed to recapture the
            populace’s adoration of Goku and his friends as they take on the might of intergalactic combatants. Plus, we’re
            pretty sure that the Kamehameha is now ingrained into the human race’s psyche. How’s that for popular.</p>
