            <h5>first day of blog, March 21, 2024</h5>
        <p style="font-size: 35px">#20: "Code Geass” (2006-08)</p>
        <img src="anime 20.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Code Geass">
        <p style=" font-size: 20px">Exiled from his home of Britannia in Japan, which his nation has conquered, Lelouch seeks to instigate a rebellion and take revenge on his father and his homeland. To accomplish this, he utilizes the show’s title ability, Geass, to make anyone he sees to exactly what he tells them, as well as leading a rebellion as a masked vigilante in a giant mech. “Code Geass” casts a wide net and has a little something for everyone, from mecha fans, to fans of psychological battles, to those who enjoy school anime; reeling them all in for one exceptional series. And with its revival movie and future series, it appears Geass hype is at an all-time high.</p>
      
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <h5>March 25, 2024</h5>
    <p style="font-size: 35px">#19: “One-Punch Man” (2015-)</p>
    <img src="anime 10.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Code Geass">
    <p style=" font-size: 20px">Who says superheroes have to be serious? Saitama may look goofy and unimpressive and he becomes a superhero for fun, but it just so happens he’s the strongest one alive. His ability to defeat nearly any opponent with just one punch earns him disbelief and occasionally admiration, as his attempts to turn pro lead to many intense and often funny battles. The series’ wonderful contrast between serious action and comedic moments is emphasized through superb animation and expertly crafted fight scenes – and being featured on both Netflix and Toonami in the states, its no surprise it became so widespread.</p>
