            <h2>THE INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <h5>
              1. Potatoes. Russet potatoes are the best potatoes for potato pancakes because they are extra starchy and bind and crisp up well. Yukon gold potatoes are denser. Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamin C, as well as vitamin B6, potassium, and manganese.
              2. Eggs. The essential ingredient for potato pancakes to bind everything together.
              3. White Whole Wheat Flour. One of my subtle, healthy swaps is white whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour, as whole wheat has more fiber and protein content than all-purpose flour.
