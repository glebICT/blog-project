      <p>The first Japanese restaurant to serve up a bowl of noodles similar to today's ramen was Yowaken 養和軒 in 1884,
        but it wasn't until 1910 that Japan had its first ramen shop called Rairaiken 来々軒 in Asakura, Tokyo. Then in
        1947 Fukuoka, the now world famous Hakata tonkotsu Ramen was actually made by sheer mistake!</p>

          <p>Dango is a tasty street food in Japan. Made from soft, yet springy ball-shaped rice dumplings on a
            skewer, dango comes in a couple of different common varieties. Matcha flavored, topped with a sweet and
            savory soy sauce glaze, smothered with chunky red bean paste, and plain white are all favorites of this
            sweet treat.</p>

              <p>It is hypothesized that curry became popular in Japan because the Imperial Japanese Navy, modeled
                after the British Navy, adopted it as a menu item for its ship's mess, or because it was on the menu
                of the Imperial Japanese Army's mess hall.</p>

                    of onigiri with them to enjoy as a quick meal during war times. Traditionally, Ume (pickled plum)
                    was put inside of the rice balls. Most of the traditional filling was pickled or salted so the
