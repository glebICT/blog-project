            <h2>Lamborghini Aventador Svj</h2>
            <p>Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the SVJ (Super Veloce Jota) is a track-focused
               iteration of the S and an improvement over the SV, with 900 units produced.[citation needed] The
               6.5-litre
               L539 V12 engine used in the entire Aventador lineage was reworked and to generate a maximum power output
               of
               770 PS (566 kW; 759 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 720 N⋅m (531 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm. Measures such as
               extensive use of carbon fibre, and titanium in the exhaust system brought the weight down to 1,525 kg
               (3,362
               lb), giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 0.5 hp/kg. The SVJ could accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62
               mph) in 2.8 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 seconds with a top speed of over 352 km/h (219
               mph).

      <h3>Lamborghini Huracan Perfomante</h3>

         track oriented variant of the Huracán, called the Performante, was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.

         The Performante underwent various exterior changes with the most noticeable being the front and rear bumpers. Carbon fibre is used for the bumpers and the side skirts. An adjustable carbon fibre rear wing has been added to increase downforce. The position of the exhaust has also been changed, and is now just a bit above the rear diffuser. The interior also underwent noticeable changes, now sporting new seats and a new digital speedometer (similar to that of the Aventador SV's speedometer).
         
         The Performante's 5.2-litre V10 has been tuned to have a power output of 471 kW (631 hp; 640 PS) at 8,000 rpm and 601 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,500 rpm. The weight has also decreased by 40 kg (88 lb), courtesy of the forged aluminium and forged carbon fibre body components (first used in the construction of the Sesto Elemento). All the new aero components on the car have active aerodynamic capability and help keep the car stable at high speeds. The Performante is capable of accelerating from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.9 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.9 seconds. It also has a theoretical top speed of 325 km/h (200 mph).
