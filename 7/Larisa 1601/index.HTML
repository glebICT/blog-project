                    The Silence of the Lambs is the story of a woman succeeding in a man's world—of having to fend off
                    advances, mask her emotions, placate her superiors, and minimize her femininity and sexuality to
                    rise.

                 Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking. The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well.

            <h2 class="Shining"> <u>The Shining</u> </h2>

            <p class="Shinings">
                Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his writer's block. He settles in along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who is plagued by psychic premonitions. As Jack's writing goes nowhere and Danny's visions become more disturbing, Jack discovers the hotel's dark secrets and begins to unravel into a homicidal maniac hell-bent on terrorizing his family.
                The Shining explores themes of cyclical violence and abuse, and Kubrick's film is full of metaphors and symbolism that have led to countless interpretations of its true meaning, including theories about sexual abuse and the ghosts being representations of violence and abuse.

        <p class="Mile">
            It stars Tom Hanks as a death row prison guard during the Great Depression who witnesses supernatural events following the arrival of an enigmatic convict (Michael Clarke Duncan) at his facility. David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell, and James Cromwell appear in supporting roles.
            'The Green Mile' (1999), directed by Fank Darabont and based on the novel of the same title by Stephen King, is an allegory of Christian healing and freedom. It represents Jesus Christ for today's society in a world poisoned and imprisoned by perception, injustices, and a more deep-set malady—the darkness of the heart.

            <p class="Gold">
                Theodore Decker was 13 years old when his mother was killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The tragedy changes the course of his life, sending him on a stirring odyssey of grief and guilt, reinvention and redemption, and even love. Through it all, he holds on to one tangible piece of hope from that terrible day -- a painting of a tiny bird chained to its perch.
                The narrative explores themes of art, beauty, trauma, fate, and the human longing for connection and belonging. Overall, "The Goldfinch" is a coming-of-age novel that delves into the complexities of life, loss, and the choices we make that shape our destinies.
