                    Peter Thomas Ratajczyk (January 4, 1962 – April 14, 2010), known professionally as Peter Steele, was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was best known as the lead singer, bassist and composer of the gothic metal band Type O Negative. Before forming Type O Negative, Steele had created the metal group Fallout and the thrash band Carnivore.

                    As the frontman for Type O Negative, Steele was known for his vampiric appearance, towering 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) stature, rich bass vocals, and a dark, often self-deprecating sense of humor. His lyrics have been described as "often intensely personal, dealing with subjects including love, loss and addiction." Steele credited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as his key musical influences. He has been listed among the "66 Best Hard Rock and Metal Frontmen of All Time" by Loudwire.
                    Steele was born on January 4, 1962, in Red Hook, Brooklyn to a Catholic family, and attended Edward R. Murrow High School located in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. His father was of Polish descent and his mother of Scottish-Irish and Italian ancestry. He was raised in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Steele was the youngest of six children, with five older sisters. His father fought in World War II and later worked at a shipyard. Steele started taking guitar lessons at age 12, before moving on to bass six months later. 

                    Though Steele was naturally left-handed, he played right-handed bass guitars throughout his career. This came about when one of his earliest bands, Aggression (also featuring Josh Silver), for which Steele played left-handed rhythm guitar, threatened to kick him out unless he switched to bass guitar. As a left-handed bass guitar proved to be too expensive at the time, Steele purchased a right-handed bass and taught himself to play it.

            <h2>Drummer</h2>
            <p>
                Type O Negative‘s surviving members and the current members of Life Of Agony have once again come under fire from their ex-drummer Sal Abruscato. The latter sat behind the drum kit for Type O Negative from 1989 to 1993, and Life Of Agony across several stints, which ultimately came to an end in 2017. Abruscato‘s exit from Life Of Agony was followed by allegations of bigotry made against him by the band’s vocalist, Mina Caputo.

                In a recently shared video, Abruscato embarked upon a lengthy diatribe, slamming his various former bandmates, sparked predominantly by the Type O Negative camp’s plans to release a “Bloody Kisses” graphic novel in celebration of the platinum-certified album’s 30th anniversary. Abruscato feels his absence from the artwork for that anniversary offering is a targeted move.
                
                That record was Absuscato‘s last with the gothic metal band, having shifted his focus to Life Of Agony afterwards. His former Life Of Agony bandmate Alan Robert was involved with this upcoming “Bloody Kisses” book, and in his below rant, Abruscato alleges Robert has been conducting a campaign behind the scenes against him, with this book just the latest in a series of slights.
