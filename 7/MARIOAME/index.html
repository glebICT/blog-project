                <h2>bassits/vocalist(died in april 4, 2010): peter steel</h2>
                <p>
                    Peter Thomas Ratajczyk (peter steel|) (January 4, 1962 – April 14, 2010), known professionally as Peter Steele, was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was best known as the lead singer, bassist and composer of the gothic metal band Type O Negative. Before forming Type O Negative, Steele had created the metal group Fallout and the thrash band Carnivore.

                    As the frontman for Type O Negative, Steele was known for his vampiric appearance, towering 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) stature, rich bass vocals, and a dark, often self-deprecating sense of humor. His lyrics have been described as "often intensely personal, dealing with subjects including love, loss and addiction." Steele credited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as his key musical influences. He has been listed among the "66 Best Hard Rock and Metal Frontmen of All Time" by Loudwire.
                    Steele was born on January 4, 1962, in Red Hook, Brooklyn to a Catholic family, and attended Edward R. Murrow High School located in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. His father was of Polish descent and his mother of Scottish-Irish and Italian ancestry. He was raised in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Steele was the youngest of six children, with five older sisters. His father fought in World War II and later worked at a shipyard. Steele started taking guitar lessons at age 12, before moving on to bass six months later. 

                    Though Steele was naturally left-handed, he played right-handed bass guitars throughout his career. This came about when one of his earliest bands, Aggression (also featuring Josh Silver), for which Steele played left-handed rhythm guitar, threatened to kick him out unless he switched to bass guitar. As a left-handed bass guitar proved to be too expensive at the time, Steele purchased a right-handed bass and taught himself to play it.

            <h2>former drummer(no longer in type o Negative): sal Abruscato</h2>
            <p>
                Type O Negative‘s surviving members and the current members of Life Of Agony have once again come under fire from their ex-drummer Sal Abruscato. The latter sat behind the drum kit for Type O Negative from 1989 to 1993, and Life Of Agony across several stints, which ultimately came to an end in 2017. Abruscato‘s exit from Life Of Agony was followed by allegations of bigotry made against him by the band’s vocalist, Mina Caputo.

                In a recently shared video, Abruscato embarked upon a lengthy diatribe, slamming his various former bandmates, sparked predominantly by the Type O Negative camp’s plans to release a “Bloody Kisses” graphic novel in celebration of the platinum-certified album’s 30th anniversary. Abruscato feels his absence from the artwork for that anniversary offering is a targeted move.
                
                That record was Absuscato‘s last with the gothic metal band, having shifted his focus to Life Of Agony afterwards. His former Life Of Agony bandmate Alan Robert was involved with this upcoming “Bloody Kisses” book, and in his below rant, Abruscato alleges Robert has been conducting a campaign behind the scenes against him, with this book just the latest in a series of slights.

                <h2>keyboardist: josh silver</h2>
                <p>
                    Josh Silver (born November 14,[1] 1962) is an American musician who is the former keyboardist, producer and backing vocalist of gothic metal band Type O Negative. He joined the band at frontman Peter Steele's request. He played for Type O Negative until they disbanded due to Steele's death in 2010.

                    Silver, who is Jewish,[2][3][4][5] was also a founding member of the short-lived rock group Fallout along with Steele. Fallout gave birth to Carnivore which ultimately led to Type O Negative. After the breakup of Fallout, Silver formed hard rock band Original Sin.
                    
                    Silver was first introduced to professional recording and production upon meeting and working with producer and Soundscape Recording Studio owner Richard Termini. Fallout's earliest recordings trace back to the Termini Soundscape sessions from the late 1970s.
                    
                    After the death of Type O Negative frontman Peter Steele, Silver became a certified EMT and then paramedic in New York, as stated by Silver, for over a year this had been his "plan B" to support his wife and children.[citation needed] Assuming at the time that the band was finished, Silver had begun EMT schooling during Steele's 2008 hiatus. He still holds his Paramedic position with the New York City Fire Department

                <h2>drummer: johnny kelly</h2>
                <p>
                    Johnny Kelly (born March 9, 1968) is an American musician, best known as the former drummer of gothic metal band Type O Negative. He is the current drummer for the bands Silvertomb, Kill Devil Hill, Eyeam, Danzig,[1] and Quiet Riot.[2]
                    Kelly joined Type O Negative in 1994 to replace Sal Abruscato.[3] During an online interview, Kelly denied the oft claimed rumor he had previously been the band's drum tech.[4]

Kelly served as a fill-in drummer for heavy metal band Pist.On on an American tour while their drummer, Jeff McManus, dealt with chronic muscle pain.[5]

On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Kelly would be replacing Will Hunt as the drummer for Black Label Society for the remainder of their European tour. He made his first live performance with the band that night at La Cigale in Paris, France.

On March 10, 2014, it was announced that Vinny Appice had left Kill Devil Hill, and that Kelly was his replacement.[6]

On January 29, 2018, it was announced on the band's website that A Pale Horse Named Death had recruited Tommy Spano of Corey Glover and Sekond Skyn as the new drummer, replacing Kelly. On April 5, 2018, it was announced that Kelly was once again the band's drummer.[7]
Kelly has been the drummer for Danzig since 2002 (with the exception of a hiatus from 2003 to 2005), and recorded drums for the band's ninth album Deth Red Sabaoth (2010), covers album Skeletons (2015), and shared drum duty on the band's latest album Black Laden Crown (2017).

                <h2>guitarist(co-founder?): kenny hickey</h2>
                <p>
                    Kenneth Shaun Hickey (born May 22, 1966) is an American musician. He was the co-founder, guitarist, and backing and occasional co-lead vocalist of the gothic metal band Type O Negative,[1] whom he played for from 1989 until the death of the band's frontman and bassist Peter Steele in 2010. He is currently the lead vocalist and guitarist for Silvertomb and was the co-founder of Seventh Void. All three bands featured fellow Type O Negative member Johnny Kelly on drums. Hickey is also an occasional touring guitarist for Danzig.
                    Hickey was born in New York City in 1966 and was raised in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn, New York. As a youngster he listened to his father's records of Johnny Cash and was diverted into rock and roll after Elton John's album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.[2] He was asked to join Type O Negative after former Carnivore guitarist Marc Piovanetti declined. Hickey was a childhood friend of the band, growing up in the same neighborhood as the band members. Hickey graduated from Xaverian High School in 1984. He has been on every Type O Negative release with fellow members Peter Steele and Josh Silver (Johnny Kelly joined in 1994).
                    In the early days of Type O Negative, Hickey could be seen playing a black Gibson Flying V. He played this for the music video of "Christian Woman." He then switched to a black Gibson SG, to which he added green accessories (knobs and pickups and a green painted fretboard), and would continue to follow this trend. Starting in 1996, he used Fernandes Guitars, starting with a Raven Elite Sustainer and Revolver Sustainer with the green additions like his previous SG. He would use this for over half a decade. He would always use the Raven live, but as seen on the music video for "I Don't Wanna Be Me", he could be seen using a Monterey Deluxe (without EMGs) in satin black, with a green fingerboard. In 2007, he began using Schecter guitars, most prominently a green C-1 Baritone. Unlike his previous guitars, this has true green inlays, exposed pickups (A Seymour Duncan SH-4 "JB" bridge, and a Sustainiac neck pickup), and the body, including the headstock, the back of the headstock and the back of the neck is entirely green. All Hickey's guitars have invariably been tuned to B Standard throughout his career.
