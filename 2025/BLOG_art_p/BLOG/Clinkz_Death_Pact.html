                Clinkz consumes the target enemy creep or friendly skeleton and creates a Burning Skeleton Archer in
                their place, healing and gaining max health. Does not take Clinkz out of Skeleton Walk.
                Archers are immobile and die within several attacks from a hero. Skeletons deal a percentage of Clinkz'
                damage. Attack range is equal to Clinkz's attack range. Only one archer can be summoned from Death Pact
                at a time.
                Skeletons deal 25% less damage to buildings
