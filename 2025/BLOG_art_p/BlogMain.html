                <p>Depeche Mode (DM) is an English electronic band formed in 1980 in Basildon. The core members include
                    Dave Gahan and Martin Gore, with Andy Fletcher until his passing in 2022.

                    Starting with synthpop, they evolved into a darker, more experimental sound. Albums like "Violator"
                    (1990) and hits like "Enjoy the Silence" made them global icons. Known for their emotional depth and
                    innovation, Depeche Mode remains one of the most influential electronic bands of all time.

                    Magnus Löfdahl. Their music blends melodic synth lines, emotional vocals, and polished production,
                    drawing from classic synthpop influences with a modern touch.

                    Their debut, "Graceful and in Sin" (2002), and follow-up, "Ultimate Sky" (2004), received praise
                    within the electronic and EBM communities. While not mainstream, Michigan has built a dedicated
                    fanbase in the European synth scene.

                    For most of their career, the band had a 7–8 piece lineup and drew from a wide range of musical
                    styles, including punk rock, pop, and folk. In 2004, several
                    long-term members left the band, which continued with a 4-piece (later 5-piece) acoustic lineup.

                    In July 2012, Chumbawamba announced they were splitting up after 30 years. The band was joined by
                    former members and collaborators for three final shows between 31 October and 3 November 2012.

                    music acts in the history
                    of popular music. In 1974, ABBA became Sweden's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest with the
                    song

                    main active years, it consisted of two couples: Fältskog and Ulvaeus, and Lyngstad and Andersson.
                    With
                    the
                    increase of their
                    popularity, their personal lives suffered, which eventually resulted in the collapse of both
                    marriages.
                    The
                    relationship changes
                    were reflected in the group's music, with later songs featuring darker and more introspective
                    lyrics.
