He lives with SpongeBob in his pineapple house on 124 Conch Street.He is a domesticated house pet with similar mannerisms to the real-world cat, most notably his "meow" sound, as snails are the underwater equivalent to cats in the show.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>My favorite SpongeBob characters are Gary the Snail, Plankton, and Patrick. Gary is SpongeBob’s loyal pet snail who always seems calm and wise, even though he mostly communicates by meowing. Plankton is the tiny but determined villain who’s always coming up with clever plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. Despite his sneaky ways, he’s kind of funny and never gives up. Patrick is SpongeBob’s best friend and the funniest starfish around—his silly and carefree nature always brings lots of laughs. Together, these characters make Bikini Bottom a much more interesting and entertaining place!SpongeBob is a great show because it’s funny, creative, and full of unforgettable characters.
