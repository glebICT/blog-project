            <div class="box1">
                <p>Although there is a Disneyland in Japan, you still must visit this one! You know the Unuversal Studios, right?
                When You enter there, it feels like you went to an unreal world. As for me, the most interesting place is the Nintendo section. It's a theme park where you will find Mario, levels from Mario, and many other different things. By clicking <a href="images.html">this link</a>, you can behold the other parts of this magical park!
