                Nara is a cool cultural town. But the "sight" in it that everybody is talking about is not a building, 
                <br>not a statue and not a monument. It is the bowing deer! And there are many of them!

                    These deer are kinda magical. You can feed them (of course with the food for deer, not some random thing). If you feed them, the deer will bow its head to you!
                    <br>These deer walk on some of the streets in Nara! and yes, this horny guy could probably be politer than you rude fellow!

                Another Shinto shrine in Japan. If you're gonna dig into its history, it's the shrine of Fujiwara family. It was reconstructed many times. It was built in 768 CE, which is quite old.
                <br>The history is long, but what about the design? The entrries are surrounded by torii gates (the red ones), the white walls and vermillion columns are looking great with the green wiids around the shrine.
                <br>A great sight to visit.
