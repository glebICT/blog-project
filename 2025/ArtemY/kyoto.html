                    A tower? Or a temple?
                    <br>A symbol of Kyoto is known as To-Ji Temple.
                    The temple can be seen from many pars of the city.
                    It actually looks like a tower.

            <p>
                Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the coolest sights of Kyoto.
                <br>The most interesting is a road followed with thousands of vermillion torii gates. The road will lead you to the sacred mount Inari.
                <br>Actually there are two of such roads. They are called Senbon Torii. Inari is dedicated to the god of rice. Kitsune (foxes) were the messangers of this god, which is why you may find lots of kitsune statues and restaurants there.
