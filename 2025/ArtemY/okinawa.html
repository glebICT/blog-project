                Famous by its beach and relaxed atmosphere.
                <br>Maybe you know, maybe you don't, but most of the Japanese are disciplined and hard-working. In Okinawa, people are very relaxed! The water is clear, the white buildings are in great harmony with the sea.
                <br>Here are some fancy places in Okinawa City:

                    In this park you can see different types of fishes, like in an aquarium. 
                    <br>But here, fish will swim naturally. They're not stuck in a place called a human-made aquarium, they live there. They are not surrounded by walls.
                    <br>This is a great experience.

                    Okinawa Japan Temple is a Christian temple. It looks very unusual, like it's not a temple at all.
                    <br>The temple combines Japnese, American, and Christian style, with something unique added.
