            <h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (ja. メタルギアソリッド3 スネーク・イータ)</h2>
            <p>The game is set in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The main character is Naked Snake, later known
                as Big Boss, a FOX operative tasked with freeing a Soviet scientist and destroying an experimental
                superweapon. Unlike previous games, where the main setting was mainly buildings and structures, Snake
                Eater takes place in the forest. Although the setting has changed, the key element of the game is still
                the unnoticed penetration into enemy territory, and the game again features heroes addressing the player
                directly. The story of Snake Eater is told through in-game scenes and radio conversations.
