            ROWING
        </h1>
        <p>Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, 
            therefore crossing the finish line backwards. Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8.
            Racing boats (often called "shells") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to minimize drag. 
             They have riggers, which apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat and (usually) a fin towards the rear which helps prevent roll and yaw. 
             Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages

                <p> 
                     A single scull (or "single" or "scull"), abbreviated as a 1x, is a racing shell designed for a single person who propels the boat with two oars, one in each hand.
                     Recreational single sculls tend to be shorter and a little wider than racing boats and can have a slightly flattened hull shape to provide more stability. Recreational single sculls can be made of a variety of materials including carbon fiber, fiberglass, wood or rotomoulded polyethylene.
                     The single scull is the 2nd slowest category of racing boat (faster than the coxed pair), and competitors are recognised by other rowers as among the toughest, both physically and mentally: single sculling is sometimes known as 'king's class'.

                    Double sculls
                </h2>
                <p>A double scull (or "double"), also abbreviated as a 2x, is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for two persons who propel the boat by sculling with two oars each, one in each hand.
                    Double sculls is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation and the Olympics.
                    In contrast to the combination of the coxed pair, in which the distribution of the riggers means the forces are staggered alternately along the boat, the symmetrical forces in sculling make the boat more efficient and so the double scull is faster than the coxless pair.

                    A quadruple sculling boat, often simply called a quad and abbreviated as a 4x, is a racing shell used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for four people who propel the boat by sculling with two oars, or "sculls", one in each hand.
                    A 'quad' is different from a 'four' in that a 'quad', or quadruple scull, is composed of four rowers each with two blades, sculling. A 'four' is made up of four rowers each with one oar in hand, sweeping.

                <p>
                    A coxless pair, abbreviated as a 2- and also known as a straight pair, is a racing shell used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for two rowers, who propel the boat with sweep oars.
                    A coxless pair is often considered the most difficult boat to row, as each rower must balance their side in cooperation with the other, apply equal power, place their catch and extract the blade simultaneously in order to move the boat efficiently.
                    "Coxless pair" is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation and is competed in the Olympic Games.

                <p>
                    A coxed pair, abbreviated as a 2+, is a racing shell used in the sport of competitive rowing. It designed for two persons who propel the boat with sweep oars and is steered by a coxswain (cox).
                    The crew consists of two rowers, each having one oar, and a cox. One rower is on the port side (rower's right hand side) and other is on the starboard side (rower's left hand side). The cox steers the boat using a rudder and may be seated at the stern of the boat (from where there is a view of the crew) or in the bow (known as a bowloader). With a bowloader, amplification is needed to communicate with the crew which is sitting behind, but the cox has a better view of the course, and the weight distribution may help the boat go faster.
