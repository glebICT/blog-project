            ROWING
        </h1>
        <p>Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, 
            therefore crossing the finish line backwards. Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8.
            Racing boats (often called "shells") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to minimize drag. 
             They have riggers, which apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat and (usually) a fin towards the rear which helps prevent roll and yaw. 
             Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages

                     A single scull (or "single" or "scull"), abbreviated as a 1x,[1] is a racing shell designed for a single person who propels the boat with two oars, one in each hand.

                <p>A double scull (or "double"), also abbreviated as a 2x, is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for two persons who propel the boat by sculling with two oars each, one in each hand.</p>
