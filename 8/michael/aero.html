            <h4>Windows Aero</h4>
            <p>Windows Aero (Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open) was the design style of Windows
                that was the mainstream style for operational systems of Microsoft from the creation of
                Vista as we know it (after <a href="longhorn.htm">Longhorn</a>) until the end
                of Windows 8's first beta release.
            </p>
            <p>Aero became popular within the popular culture, especially with the popularisation of
                Frutiger Aero aesthetic, although nowadays it's not as popular, you cannot deny that it left
                a massive footstep in the personal computer's history, as Windows 7 is sometimes considered
                as peak work of Microsoft.
