                <h4>Hong Kong Disneyland<span id="hide">&nbsp;Click Me</span>!</h4>

            <p>
                Hong Kong Disneyland, also known as HK Disneyland is a theme
                park located on reclaimed land in Penny's Bay, Lantau Island, Hong Kong. It was the first Disneyland in
                Asia outside of Japan until Shanghai Disneyland in 2016. Hong Kong Disneyland is located inside the
                Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and is owned and managed by Hong Kong International Theme Parks. It is the
                most visited theme park in Hong Kong, followed by Ocean Park Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland opened
                to visitors on Monday, September 12, 2005, at 13:00 HKT. Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural
                backlash by incorporating Chinese culture, customs, and traditions when designing and building the
                resort, including adherence to the rules of feng shui. Notably, a bend was put in a walkway near the
                Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy would not flow into the South China Sea. The
                designs made it the smallest of the Disney parks.

                <h5>The Big Buddha<span id="hide">&nbsp;Click Me</span>!</h5>
            </a>
            <p>
                The Big Buddha is a large bronze statue of Buddha, completed in 1993, and located at Ngong Ping, Lantau
                Island, in Hong Kong. The statue, located near the Po Lin Monastery which built it, is a tourist
                attraction. The 34 m tall statue weighs over 250 metric tons, and was
                constructed from 202 bronze pieces. In addition to the exterior components, there is a strong steel
                framework inside to support the heavy load. Visitors have to climb 268 steps to reach the Buddha,
                though the site also features a small winding road for vehicles to provide access for disabled people.
                The Buddha's right hand is raised, representing the removal of affliction, while the left rests open on
                his lap in a gesture of generosity. The statue's official name is Phra Phutta Ming Mongkol Eknakakiri,
                which means "the Cherished Auspicious Lord Buddha atop Nāga Hill".
                The name is a blend of native Thai, Sanskrit, and Pali words.
