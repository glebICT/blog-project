    A square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four sides of equal 
    length and four 90-degree angles (π/2 radian angles). It can also be defined 
    as a rectangle with two equal-length adjacent sides. 
    It is the only regular polygon whose internal angle, central angle, 
    and external angle are all equal (90°), and whose diagonals are all equal 
    in length.
